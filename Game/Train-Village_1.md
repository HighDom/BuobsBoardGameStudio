# Goal

As many villagers connected to your home base as possible

# How?

each turn you get one action. Get a new level 1 card or replace a level x with level x+1.

if you connect to a village you put a down a marker
if the opponent already owns the village it belongs to him unless your railway is faster. then you can take over (1/2 simulating resistance to change from villagers?)

(Extra difficulty. you can only upgrade a tile if the previous (connection from home to current tile, if multiple you can choose (bypassing levels)) tile was the same level as yours)
